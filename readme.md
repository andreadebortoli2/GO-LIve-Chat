### A web app with live chat

This is a basic app where you can register, login and live chat, the admin can also edit user to give or remove superior access permission.

Once started you can chat simultaneously between different browsers.

To try the app:
- in editor terminal, with the command ```air```  start the app in developer mode
- open multiple browsers at [localhost](http://localhost:8080/)
- register an account or login with one of the already existing profiles
  - username: admin
    - email: admin@admin.com
    - password: password
  - username: moderator
    - email: moderator@moderator.com
    - password: password
  - username: user
    - email: user@user.com
    - password: password
- chat simultaneously between the browsers
- admin can access to users list to delete user or modify the access level
